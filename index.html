    <p>
      My apparition rose from the fall of lead,<br>
Declared, 'I am a civilian.' It only served<br>
To aggravate your fright. For how could I<br>
Have risen, a being of this world, in that hour<br>
Of impartial death! And I thought also: nor is<br>
Your quarrel of this world.</p>

<p>You stood still<br>
For both eternities, and oh I heard the lesson<br>
Of your traing sessions, cautioning;<br>
Scorch earth behind you, do not leave<br>
A dubious neutral to the rear. Reiteration<br>
Of my civilian quandary, burrowing earth<br>
From the lead festival of your more eager friends<br>
Worked the worse on your confusion, and when<br>
You brought the gun to bear on me, and death<br>
Twitched me gently in the eye, your plight<br>
And all of you came clear to me.</p>
      <p>I hope some day<br>
Intent upon my trade of living, to be checked<br>
In stride by your apparition in a trench,<br>
Signalling, I am a soldier. No hesitation then<br>
But I shall shoot you clean and fair<br>
With meat and bread, a gourd of wine<br>
A bunch of breasts from either arm, and that<br>
Lone question; do you friend, even now, know<br>
What it is all about?</p>
